{"name":"Yajam","tagline":"FreeBSD jail management tool relying heavily on ZFS","body":"Welcome to yajam\r\n================\r\n\r\nyajam (*yet another jail manager*) is a tool designed to efficiently and\r\nsecurely manage a larger number of FreeBSD jails. Other than existing tools do,\r\nyajam does not use\r\n[nullfs](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_nullfs) to share parts\r\nof the base system among several jails. As of today, there are a few good points\r\nfor not doing so anymore:\r\n\r\n* disk space is cheap, and the FreeBSD base system is not that big (in\r\n  comparison to the sizes of modern hard disks)\r\n* a dedicated userland per jail allows flexibility with the userland version\r\n  (as long as the jail's FreeBSD userland version is smaller than or equal to\r\n  the host's FreeBSD version)\r\n* and finally, not using nullfs means not being exposed to any potential\r\n  jail-breaking bug (this doesn't mean there currently is one, but file pointer\r\n  issues have already be seen to be a source of hassle in the past, so I\r\n  wouldn't bet my life on the safety of nullfs for now and all times)\r\n\r\nyajam puts a strong focus on security and reliability. Therefore, it implements\r\nsome additional restrictions:\r\n\r\n* to foster reliability, jails are created, updated or upgraded from the\r\n  FreeBSD source tree\r\n  ([freebsd-update](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update) is\r\n  not necessarily the most reliable tool when it comes to **not** breaking an\r\n  existing FreeBSD installation)\r\n* the source tree(s) used to build the jails are kept separate from the host\r\n  system's source tree, allowing to apply dedicated restrictions for jails via\r\n  `src.conf` limitations\r\n* although each jail has got it's own base system, it is kept read-only\r\n  wherever possible (i. e. anything but `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/tmp` and\r\n  `/usr/local`), and setuid is only allowed within the read-only part of a jail\r\n  to hedge about malicious manipulations\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
