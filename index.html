<p>yajam (<em>yet another jail manager</em>) is a tool designed to efficiently and
securely manage a larger number of FreeBSD jails. Other than existing tools do,
yajam does not use
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_nullfs">nullfs</a> to share parts
of the base system among several jails. As of today, there are a few good points
for not doing so anymore:</p>

<ul>
<li>disk space is cheap, and the FreeBSD base system is not that big (in
comparison to the sizes of modern hard disks)</li>
<li>a dedicated userland per jail allows flexibility with the userland version
(as long as the jail's FreeBSD userland version is smaller than or equal to
the host's FreeBSD version)</li>
<li>and finally, not using nullfs means not being exposed to any potential
jail-breaking bug (this doesn't mean there currently is one, but file pointer
issues have already be seen to be a source of hassle in the past, so I
wouldn't bet my life on the safety of nullfs for now and all times)</li>
</ul>

<p>yajam puts a strong focus on security and reliability. Therefore, it implements
some additional restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>to foster reliability, jails are created, updated or upgraded from the
FreeBSD source tree
(<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update">freebsd-update</a> is
not necessarily the most reliable tool when it comes to <strong>not</strong> breaking an
existing FreeBSD installation)</li>
<li>the source tree(s) used to build the jails are kept separate from the host
system's source tree, allowing to apply dedicated restrictions for jails via
<code>src.conf</code> limitations</li>
<li>although each jail has got it's own base system, it is kept read-only
wherever possible (i. e. anything but <code>/home</code>, <code>/etc</code>, <code>/var</code>, <code>/tmp</code> and
<code>/usr/local</code>), and setuid is only allowed within the read-only part of a jail
to hedge about malicious manipulations</li>
</ul>
